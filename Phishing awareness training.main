 What is Phishing?
Phishing is a type of cyberattack where criminals try to trick you into giving away sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data by pretending to be a trustworthy source (e.g., your bank, employer, or popular services like Netflix or Amazon).




1.Recognizing Phishing Emails
Phishing emails may look real, but they usually contain warning signs like:

Urgency or threats (‚ÄúYour account will be closed in 24 hours‚Äù).

Spelling and grammar errors.

Suspicious links or attachments.

Fake email addresses pretending to be official.

Generic greetings (‚ÄúDear Customer‚Äù) instead of using your name.



        
  2.       Fake Websites
Attackers often create fake websites that look identical to real ones. You might be redirected to them from a phishing email.

üîç Signs of a fake website:

Slightly misspelled URLs (e.g., paypall.com instead of paypal.com)

No HTTPS (üîí lock symbol missing)

Poor design or outdated layout





3. Social Engineering Tactics
Phishing is just one part of social engineering, where attackers exploit human psychology. Common tactics:

Pretexting: Pretending to be someone you trust (e.g., IT helpdesk).

Baiting: Offering something tempting (e.g., a free gift) to get you to click.

Tailgating: Physically following you into restricted areas.

Quishing: Sending QR codes that lead to malicious links.





4. Best Practices to Avoid Phishing
‚úÖ Think before you click. Don‚Äôt open suspicious links or attachments.

‚úÖ Verify the sender. Contact the source directly using trusted channels.

‚úÖ Keep software and antivirus tools updated.

‚úÖ Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

‚úÖ Report suspicious messages to your IT/security team.





   5.     Real-World Examples
In 2020, hackers used a phishing email to access Twitter's admin tools, allowing them to hijack high-profile accounts (like Elon Musk and Barack Obama).

In 2016, attackers fooled a Clinton campaign chairman into clicking a fake Google sign-in page.
